My first repository; straight from the guides!

This is the edit I am making by following the guides diligently.
I view myself as a happy person who tries to help others. The world that surrounds me at the moment is pretty negative.
Coding is just my love and passion and I hope to come out fo the darkness I am in by the light rays of coding.
